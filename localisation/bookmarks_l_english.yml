 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "새천년의 새벽"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "세상이 바뀌었습니다. 전세계적으로 말하길, 평화와 번영의 분위기는 약 반세기동안 지속되었습니다. 그러나 냉전이 종식되고, 최근 중화인민공화국이 부상하고있습니다, 이세상이 어떻게 될까요? How will it shape itself? 미국이 계속 우위를 점할수있을까? 새로운 러시아연방이 현상황에 대한 돌파구를 찾을것인가? 유럽의 위대한제국이였던 국가들은 어떻게될까요? 그리고 테러리스트들은 어떻게 될가요? 세계가 변했습니다. 지금도 변화하고있습니다."
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark is in a safe and sound spot, being both a member of the EU and NATO. Internal economic downturn and slowdown have however been recently challenging the Danish state."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "홍콩이 1997년 중국으로 반환되자, 영국은 자신이 소유하고있는 마지막 식민지를 잃었습니다. 한때 지구상을 주무르던 대영제국은 이제 새로운 길을 찾기위해 필사적으로 노력하고있습니다. 미국과 협력을 유지할것인가? 유럽의 국가들에게 다가가야할까? 아니면 새로이 대영제국을 재건해야할까요?"
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea."
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and is about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "과거 강대국이였던 프랑스는, 끊임없이 변화하는 세계에서 새로운 자리를 찾으려 노력했습니다. 프랑스의 오랜 라이벌과 옛친구가 프랑스편에서나아간다면, 새로운 위협에 직면하여, 프랑스는 민주주의의 화합과 평화 또는 어두웠던 시대로 돌아가야할것인지를 결정해야합니다."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "독일이 통일된지 10년이 흘렀습니다. 경제력은 과거보다 훨신 강해졌지만, 경기침체의 전망이 보이기 시작하면서, 독일은 이세상에서 새로운 목표를 찾아야합니다. 또한 소련의 위성국에서 벗어난 동유럽국가들은 독일의 영향력이큰 유럽연합에 가입하고싶어합니다. 독일은 어두웠던 과거로인해 어려움을 겪었지만 밝은미래가 독일을 기다리고있습니다."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "지구상에서 두번째로 큰 경제대국인 일본은 ,제2차 세계대전이 끝난뒤로 동아시아 민주주의 국가의 강자로 부상했습니다. 유럽의 동맹국들과 미국이 뒷받침하고 강력한 산업기반을가진 읿본은, 오랜 라이벌 중국을 새로운 자신감으로 바라봅니다."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After the defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought them back up to the state of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"
 NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to some point. Norway however still remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "중국, 어제의 약했던 중국이 이젠 초강대국이 되어있습니다.산업기반도 강력하고, 정치적 영향력도 점점커지고있습니다, 군 현대화와 인력이 거의 무한하다해도, 중국에겐 하나의 약점이 있습니다: 너무 늦게 개혁한다면 중국은 무너질것입니다. 그러나 너무빠르게 개혁해도 스스로를 파괴할것입니다."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Where China is the super power of tomorrow, India is the super power of next week. Its constant struggles against Pakistan and China as well as its deep economic connection to the west have given India a niche to prosper. If it is given enough time, the Tiger of South Asia will be strong enough to take out every single one of its enemies."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "소련이 1991년에 붕괴하고, 러시아 연방의 길은 쉽지 않을것이라는게 분명해졌습니다. 체제와 경제는 크게 부패하고, 군대는 규모가 크지만 낡고 구식이였습니다, 러시아는 현실을 받아들여야만 했습니다. 하지만 지금, 영광의 그날로 되돌아갈때입니다."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing only little to amend the issues. Sweden, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Neutral since times immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad in order to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "미국 시민들은 지난 세기동안 거의 모든곳에서 승리를 거두었습니다. 세계대전에서의 승리, 냉전 승리, 미국은 지금까지 거의 완벽한 승률을 보였습니다. 그러나 중국이 점점 부상하고있으며, 러시아가 새로운 영광을 위해 나아가고있습니다, 테러의 위협도 점점 커지고있는 와중에, 미국이 세계를 계속 지배할수잇을가요?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "현대 시대"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "With China claiming territorial waters around its coastlines, with Russia marching into Crimea, with the terrorist Islamic State proclaiming its caliphate, will the world stay the same? The United Kingdom is experiencing unwillingness to continue European integration. Recent terrorist attacks have the entirety of the French national principles shaken. Refugees are seeking shelter from wars and unrest in Syria and Libya. The next presidential election in the USA might be the most decisive one since 1940. The world is still changing."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignity not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "France has suffered from economic hardship and from major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their muslim and jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at a possibility to perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Germany, hit by refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbors grow increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren on Crimea. That about sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March of 2014. With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended. The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading. The next president of the United States will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on earth, the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
